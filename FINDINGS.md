# NOBBLE findings

Interim. Written while the benchmark campaign is still running, and every number
here is from a partial run at tier-1 settings (3 recycles, 1 diffusion sample,
potentials off), which spec 1.2 defines as deliberately cheap triage. Tier 2
re-runs the top decile at 10 recycles and 25 diffusion samples. Nothing below is
a tier-2 result and nothing below is a discovery claim.

## F1. Geometry against the empirical envelope separates poses that ipTM cannot

The first benchmark pair, GSPT1 / CRBN / CC-885, is the pair spec 3.1 calls "the
highest-value single test in the panel". Across its fifteen completed tier-1
jobs, three independent signals were measured: Boltz's receptor-to-peptide ipTM,
whether the peptide is docked onto the receptor at all, and whether the glue
actually bridges receptor to peptide under BINMAN's bridging filter.

| complex | conditioning | seed | ipTM | peptide docked | glue bridges | bridge percentile |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| binary | unconstrained | 1-5 | 0.838 to 0.893 | yes, all five | n/a | n/a |
| ternary | conditioned | 1 | 0.885 | yes | **yes** | 54.1 |
| ternary | conditioned | 2 | 0.877 | yes | no | - |
| ternary | conditioned | 3 | 0.806 | yes | no | - |
| ternary | conditioned | 4 | 0.082 | **no**, 81.4 A away | no | - |
| ternary | conditioned | 5 | 0.911 | yes | no | - |
| ternary | unconstrained | 1 | 0.889 | yes | **yes** | 53.9 |
| ternary | unconstrained | 2 | 0.890 | yes | **yes** | 50.4 |
| ternary | unconstrained | 3 | 0.822 | yes | no | - |
| ternary | unconstrained | 4 | 0.916 | yes | no | - |
| ternary | unconstrained | 5 | 0.914 | yes | no | - |

Three things follow.

**ipTM does not distinguish a bridging pose from a non-bridging one.** A pose
that bridges scores 0.885; one that does not scores 0.877. The highest ipTM in
the whole ternary set, 0.916, does not bridge. This is a sharper version of the
caveat spec 4.5 already requires the app to state, and it is the direct
justification for spec 4.1's choice of the empirical bridge percentile as the
primary signal rather than the model's own confidence.

**Only 3 of 10 ternary trajectories produce the ternary architecture at all.** In
the other seven the peptide is docked on CRBN and the glue is in its pocket, but
the glue buries less than 25 square angstrom against the peptide, which is
BINMAN's floor for a half-interface and a very low bar for a 15-mer. The glue
and the degron are both present and not in contact. The three that do bridge sit
at the 50th to 54th percentile of 285,996 experimentally observed bridges, which
is a credible mid-range glue interface rather than an outlier.

**One trajectory failed to dock the peptide at all**, leaving it 81.4 angstrom
from the receptor centroid in free solvent, and Boltz's ipTM of 0.082 reported
that correctly. This is a failed run rather than a weak interface, and the
distinction changes what every downstream aggregate means (see D-NOB-023).

**Conditioning did not help.** The conditioned arm, which forces the glue into
the pocket measured from 5HXB, produced one bridge in five seeds; the
unconstrained arm produced two in five. That is consistent with spec 4.7's own
warning that forcing a binder into a site it did not choose "reliably produces
the right neighbourhood and the wrong pose", and it is why agreement between the
two arms is the signal rather than the conditioned result alone.

## F2. Pose convergence is poor at tier-1 settings, and it is informative

Pairwise peptide backbone RMSD across seeds, superposed on the receptor (436
anchor atoms, receptor RMSD after superposition 0.23 angstrom, so the frame is
sound):

| condition | mean | max |
|---|---|---|
| binary | 11.4 A | 17.1 A |
| ternary, conditioned | 43.1 A | 98.5 A |
| ternary, unconstrained | 22.1 A | 36.8 A |

Some seed pairs agree to 1.7 to 4.3 angstrom; others are tens of angstrom apart,
which for a 109-residue receptor domain means the peptide is on a different part
of the protein. Spec 4.4 predicted this would be the more honest measure for
peptides than confidence, and on this pair it is: the convergence spread
identifies the same seeds the geometry filter rejects, while ipTM does not.

Poor convergence at tier 1 is partly expected, since tier 1 runs a single
diffusion sample precisely to keep triage cheap. Whether tier 2's 25 samples
recover a converged pose is a question this campaign will answer directly, and
it is the right question to put to the Benchmark tab.

## F3. One of the seven scoring signals has no demonstrated discriminating power

Spec 4 lists seven signals "in descending order of trust". The second,
the lysine reach window, is not a validated predictor: BINMAN attempted the fit
and it failed, reaching AUC 0.4223, 0.4770 and 0.4595 on its three Cb-Cb
boundaries over 369 assayed lysines, with the direction slightly inverted.

The explanation is mechanistic and so unlikely to yield to refitting: the ligand
site is where a substrate is recruited, not where ubiquitin is transferred, and
the E2 that transfers it is not in the construct. NOBBLE therefore reports
lysine geometry as a measurement with an explicit `not_validated` status and
emits no `lysine_reach_fit` score. See D-NOB-024.

This matters for the composite of spec 4.8, which multiplies a weight by exactly
that quantity. The component is kept as a candidate for the weight fit, but its
fitted weight will be published next to these AUCs so nobody reads a non-zero
weight as validation.

## Pending

Remaining benchmark pairs, the Sievers matched-control ROC, lysine reach, PLIP
fingerprints, the time-split blind number and composite weight fitting. The
seed-collapse rate across the whole panel is itself a reportable number: if a
run in five commonly fails to dock, the five-seed budget of spec 1.2 is too
small for a minimum-based statistic, and that is a finding about the method.

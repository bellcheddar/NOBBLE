# NOBBLE build log

2026-11-03T18:39:32Z  Phase 0: hardware probe written and run. Apple M2 Ultra, 16P/8E cores, 128 GB, 60 GPU cores, 507 GB free, MPS available on torch 2.10.0.
2026-11-03T18:53:39Z  Phase 1: BINMAN store reader. All 12 curated sources present; row counts match spec 2.1 exactly. Degronopedia and ProtCID confirmed unavailable (BINMAN G7).
2026-11-03T18:53:39Z  Phase 1: benchmark panel resolver. 7/7 resolve. MGTbind encodes multi-protein receptors as underscore-joined composite accessions, so matching is by token set; MGTbind carries no PROTACs, so the two BRD4 arms resolve from PROTAC-DB (5T35, 6BNB).
2026-11-03T18:53:39Z  Phase 1: all seven benchmark depositions already present in BINMAN's assembly cache. Ligand CCDs read from structure: 85C, 759, Y70, LVY, EF6, RC8.
2026-11-03T18:53:39Z  Phase 1: GSPT1 degron gate failed, then resolved. Root cause was a numbering frame mismatch of 138 residues, not a Degron Scan bug: deposited G575 is canonical 437, which is exactly the scan's second-ranked hairpin tip. Added nobble/curate/numbering.py. Gate now 2/2.
2026-11-03T18:53:39Z  Phase 1: receptor constructs from InterPro boundaries. Six constructs, token counts measured. DDB1 reduced to BPC alone on measured CR-8 contacts, avoiding a third exception. DCAF15 measures 1229 tokens against the spec's ~900 estimate.
2026-11-03T18:53:39Z  Phase 1: tests/test_phase1.py, 9 passed. All three testable Phase 1 gates pass.
2026-11-03T19:25:33Z  Phase 1: Tier A 17 ligases (10 of 12 spec-named present; FEM1B and DDB1 absent from BINMAN triage). Tier B gate passes: 15 ligases, frozen to data/tier_b_selection.parquet. Open Targets tumour_enriched is 0 for all 650 rows, so filter 4 is skipped and recorded (D-NOB-017); DCAF8L1, CCNF and ASB8 come out at ranks 1-3 exactly as spec 3.3 predicts.
2026-11-03T19:25:33Z  Phase 1: peptide library 25,567 unique candidates (7 benchmark, 12,029 curated degron, 160 Sievers matched, 558 C-degron, 12,813 scrambles). 332 carry a required PTM.
2026-11-03T19:25:33Z  Phase 1: ESM-2 t12 35M diversity reduction on MPS, 25,567 -> 220 in 12s, priority-ordered with every positive followed by its own scramble.
2026-11-03T19:25:33Z  Phase 1: 11 receptor MSAs precomputed via Boltz's own MMseqs2 client, depths 530 to 10,292, cached content-addressed under data/msa/. DDB1 BPC shared between two constructs.
2026-11-03T19:25:33Z  Phase 1: gap-aware frame resolver (D-NOB-020). Fixed four unmeasurable benchmark pockets. CRBN tri-tryptophan pocket recovered independently from 5HXB, 6H0F and 5FQD, all agreeing on W380/W386/W400.
2026-11-03T19:25:33Z  Phase 1: benchmark manifest 7 pairs, 105 jobs, 0 errors, 10 warnings (all smiles_fallback for dBET57). jobs_per_pair computed as 15 (D-NOB-019).
2026-11-03T19:25:33Z  Phase 2: campaign assembled, 100 YAMLs emitted (5 conditioned jobs dropped for member 3, which has no measurable pocket). Smoke test passed: 124-token job in 42.5s on MPS, 0.343 s/token. Full 100-job queue launched in tmux; resume verified (skipped the completed job).
